# Each line is a file pattern followed by one or more owners.
# Order is important; the last matching pattern takes the most
# precedence.

# These owners will be the default owners for everything in
# the repo. Unless a later match takes precedence,
# @xyrhythm and @fenghaolw will be requested for
# review when someone opens a pull request.
*   @xyrhythm @fenghaolw

# @wyy1991 owns /app/
/app/   @wyy1991 @xyrhythm

# @xyrhythm owns /data_store/
/data_store/    @xyrhythm

# @fenghaolw owns /server/
/server/    @fenghaolw @xyrhythm

# @fenghaolw owns /web/
/web/   @fenghaolw @xyrhythm


############################# Below are not used but just examples.
# Use this pattern for file extenstions.
# When someone opens a pull request that only
# modifies JS files, only @js-owner and not the global
# owner(s) will be requested for a review.
#.js    @js-owner


# The `docs/*` pattern will match files like
# `docs/getting-started.md` but not further nested files like
# `docs/build-app/troubleshooting.md`.
# docs/*  docs@example.com

# In this example, @octocat owns any file in an apps directory
# anywhere in your repository.
# apps/ @octocat

# In this example, @doctocat owns any file in the `/docs`
# directory in the root of your repository.
# /docs/ @doctocat
