Web App for ML Training Data Labeling Tool

## Installation

First install dependencies:
```sh
npm install
```

Now you can run your local server:
```sh
npm start
```
Server is located at http://localhost:8080

NOTE: `npm start` only starts dev server. This does not bring up a backend server that connects to the MySQL database.

To see the actual data from MySQL, run
```sh
npm run server
```
